    tags: ["YOLO", "PyTorch", "Computer Vision", "Real-Time Detection", "AI"],
    details: {
      challenge: "Drowsy driving is a major cause of road accidents, and there was a need for an accurate, real-time detection system that could alert drivers before fatigue leads to dangerous situations.",
      solution: "Developed a YOLO-based computer vision model in PyTorch to detect signs of driver drowsiness by monitoring facial landmarks such as eye closure and yawning frequency. The system processes live video feed from a camera and triggers an audible alert when drowsiness is detected.",
      impact: [
        "Achieved over 90% detection accuracy in controlled test scenarios.",
        "Reduced reaction time to driver fatigue by providing immediate visual and audio alerts.",
        "Designed a modular architecture that can be integrated into vehicle infotainment or safety systems."

  tags: ["Python", "Web Scraping", "Ensemble Learning", "Flask", "Image Classification"],
  details: {
    challenge: "There was no lightweight and accurate way to recognize celebrity images via a web interface, especially using scraped data without huge datasets.",
    solution: "Built a pipeline to scrape celebrity images via Google Images, processed them using OpenCV and NumPy, trained an ensemble of models—including XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression—and deployed the classifier through a Flask-based web UI.",
    impact: [
      "Achieved reliable recognition across five popular personalities with limited dataset size (~900 images).",
      "Delivered a responsive Flask app for real-time image classification via drag-and-drop interface.",
      "Demonstrated how to combine web scraping, feature engineering, and ensemble learning into a cohesive, user-facing project."
