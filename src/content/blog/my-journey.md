# You can know me better here.

I was born on a hot summer day, perhaps that’s why I carry a little of summer with me. I grew up in a warm, traditional Indian family. My parents are simple people, and to me they are the most extraordinary humans on earth. I have a younger brother who means the world to me.

As a child I was outgoing and endlessly imaginative. I invented story-games and dragged my friends into them every day. I lived inside those stories, tales of superheroes, zombies, and Power Rangers (I always chose to be the Red Ranger). Cardboard forts in my grandfather’s backyard became whole dreamlands. I’ve always been a storyteller, and I always will be. So here I am, sharing my story with you, my friends.

I’ve always loved trying new things -art, tech, sports. 

In my early years I moved often between my grandparents’ home and my parents’ house in the city where my father worked. Along the way I made more friends than I expected kind kids welcomed me into their circles. 

Books are my closest companions. I’m fascinated not just by stories but by the lives of the people who write them- Why they wrote what they wrote? 

My love for writing began in my early teens when my school teacher praised my work; that encouragement kept me writing, and it still does.

And other than that I love pizza, coffee, music, movies, anime, books, adventure, mountains, beaches, flowers, chocolates and a lot more stuffs.

Here, I quote something written by Albert Camus:

“The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”

That line resonates with me. Becoming is not about arrival; it is about ascent. It is about choosing meaning, even in repetition.

The hardest question I still face is: Who am I?

So here I am - unfiltered, unfinished, figuring it out in real time.

Join me on this exciting journey of becoming me.
